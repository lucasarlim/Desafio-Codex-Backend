## 💻 About <a name = "about"></a>

The challenge is to develop the backend part of an API that aims to manage the user's daily routine. In a simplified way, it is a system in which you can add the activities that will be carried out throughout the day so that the user has better control of what he needs to do and what has already been done.

## ✔️ User Stories <a name = "user_stories"></a>

<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to add tasks to the system.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to name each of these tasks (at the time of its creation).</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to remove a task from the system.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like to be able to rename the tasks.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like to be able to list all tasks.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to add priorities to the tasks, being only High or Low.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to sort tasks by a higher priority.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to register in the system.</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like to be able to login to the system (using JWT).</p>
<p>I, as a user, would like it to be possible to log out of the system.</p>
